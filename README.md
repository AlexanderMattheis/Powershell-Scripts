# Relationship-Enhancement-Scripts
Are you constantly stressed by your operating system? You are constantly in dispute?
Then I have something for you, the Relationship-Enhancement-Scripts for a better, trustworthy cooperation
between humans and machines. That scripts should simplify your life and give you more control over your operating system.
All scripts can be directly executed under Windows without any installation of further software.

**Hint:** You can install Powershell on your Mac and Linux system, too.
But the scripts were written with Powershell 5.1+ and designed for Windows 10 Version 1703 up to 1803.
So, I cannot guarantee that they will work on other systems than Windows 10 Version 1703 up to 1803.
