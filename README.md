# Relationship-Enhancement-Scripts
Are you constantly stressed by your operating system? You are constantly in dispute?
Then I have something for you, the Relationship-Enhancement-Scripts for a better, trustworthy cooperation
between humans and machines. That scripts should simplify your life and give you more control over your operating system.
All scripts can be directly executed under Windows without any installation of further software.

**Hint:** You can install Powershell on your Mac and Linux system, too.
But the scripts were written with Powershell 5.1+ and designed for Windows 10 Version 1703 up to 1803.
So, I cannot guarantee that they will work on other systems than Windows 10 Version 1703 up to 1803.

## Dated Folder Creator
Creates a number of folders with the current date and a count with padding in the format `yyyy-MM-dd-[count]`
e.g. `2018-10-14-01, 2018-10-14-02, ..., 2018-10-14-12`.

## Files Lister
Lists all files from current directory with different settings.

## Recursive DOC/DOCX to PDF Converter
Converts all `*.doc(x)`-files in a folder and subfolders into `*.pdf`-files (tested with Microsoft Word 2016).

## Services Lister
Lists the names from services.

## Windows 10 Configurator
Configures Windows 10 Version 1703 up to 1803 after a reinstallation:
- activates the classic photo viewer

- sets the taskbar glom-level i.e. taskbar buttons only combined if necessary
